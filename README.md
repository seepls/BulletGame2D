learning game development more ... 

start by creating Game.java and GamePanel.java 
then as the program runs really fast , as fast as the machine can ,we need to set control over our play .
so the next ..
we set up the FramePerSecond (FPS)
using the inbulit : System.nanoTime() // gives the current time in millisecond ;
in the next step we move to create players and take user input from the keyboard .
