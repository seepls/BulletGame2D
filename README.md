learning game development more ... 

start by creating Game.java and GamePanel.java 
then as the program runs really fast , as fast as the machine can ,we need to set control over our play .
so the next ..
we set up the FramePerSecond (FPS)
using the inbulit : System.nanoTime() // gives the current time in millisecond ;
in the next step we move to create players and take user input from the keyboard to move him around.

next we create bullets .
Z for hitting
created enemies .
similar point size :  distance formula used to check if collision .
wave spawning system for the enemies .
set up lives as well visible on top left .


now we have done nothing yet when the enemies and player collide , so we do that now . :) 

now when the player and enemy collide , we reduce the life of the player .
change the color to RED when hit : for a while .
also we added the score at the right top . 

next we are going to PowerUp . ! 

in power up ; we add 3 kinds : 
1st increases life ; 
and the other 2 increase poer by 1 and 2 ; 

next we set up their interaction ( e. i player and powerups ) 

now created more enemies , differing with level and power and health ...

final touch up remaining!!! pretty excited .
